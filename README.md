# Practicing with BackTracking

## Word.java
This is an example of Permutation.

How many words can you make out of the word `DOG`?

**TODO: Can you save all the words into a list instead of printing them out one by one?**


##  Combination.java

This is an example of Combination.

How many possible ways to pick  out of 9 Supreme Court justices for a majority decision?

**TODO: Save all solutions in a list instead of printing them out in the recursive method.**

## SubsetSum.java

Another example of Combination. Given a set of numbers and a target, find a subset that adds up to the target.

Unlike the previous example, this recursive method stops when a solution is found.

**TODO: Make changes so the program searches for all possible solutions.**

## Queen.java

This is a popular backtracking problem/interview question. Find solutions to place n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens can each other.
